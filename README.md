# Cursor-Codemirror

Hello! This is an old version of [Cursor](https://cursor.so/) based off of the [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) text editing component. If you're looking to build your own code editor, this may serve as a useful guide üôÇ

## Getting Started

To get started:

```
git clone git@github.com:getcursor/cursor.git
cd cursor
npm i
```

Then, download some non-versioned dependencies (ripgrep binaries and language server js):

```
./setup.sh # Mac/Linux
./setup.ps1 # Windows
```

Finally, to run the client:

```
npm start
```
